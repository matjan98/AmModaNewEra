# Rebuild and Test

After making code changes, **always** rebuild the solution and run tests.

1. **Rebuild** (from repo root / solution directory):
   ```bash
   dotnet build AmModaNewEra.sln
   ```

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test AmModaNewEra.sln --no-build
   ```

Run both before considering the task done. Fix any build or test failures.

For quick verification of a specific area, you can filter tests, e.g.:
```bash
dotnet test CodebaseTests\CodebaseTests.csproj --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~NazwaTestu"
```
